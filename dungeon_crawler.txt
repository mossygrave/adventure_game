Final Programming Project Plan

Basics
    The user will travel through different rooms in the dungeon, exploring, collecting items, and fighting monsters
    Each monster will have different attacks or abilities (attack patterns)
    I'll use a randomizer and a loop to count the number of rounds so monsters can power up attacks
    The goal is to escape the dungeon.

Keywords
    Loot: Loot the current room and return items or gold. Used after defeating a monster or entering a room with a chest 
    Attack: Attack the current monster (Read the item dictionary and return attack power. Random chance to crit)
    Block: Defend against an attack from an enemy (Deflects a percentage of an attack) (Leveling system to determine percentage?)
    Stats: See your current stats, equipped weapons, atk pwr, health etc
    Use Item: Prints a list of usable items in your inventory with what they do
    Move: Shows what directions the player can go and allows them to choose one (Store and recount previous move)
